# Necrotizing-Enterocolitis

This is reproducibility exercise for a metagenomic study on Necrotizing Enterocolitis from biostar book


### Setting up Environment in lxc cluster

I'm using lxc cluster in the University of Liverpool. You can srt up the enviroment using: 

```
cd /volatile/batool/KAIMRC/Necrotizing_enterocolitis

. env.sh
```
or if you aren't using lxc, you can run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```
